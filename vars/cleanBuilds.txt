      The <code>cleanBuilds</code> function offers a housekeeeping for the integration pipeline.<br>
      Every build of the integration pipeline which was deployed on an environment is automatically kept.
      To prevent a numerous amount of kept builds this variable is cleaning up these jobs. It distinguishes between deployment for every environment.
