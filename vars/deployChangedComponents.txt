<p>
  This function can be used to deploy a component (or a set of components) from a specific integration pipeline to a distinct environment.<br>
  It provides multiple features:
  <ul>
    <li>checks the version of components that are last deployed on a specific environment</li>
    <li>checks the version of components that should be deployed on that specific environment</li>
    <li>deploy the delta set of components on that specific environment</li>
    <li>add a deployment badge that to the deployment pipeline job to indicate that a deployment was done for that specific environment</li>
  </ul>
  The integration pipeline has to provide a valid component-versions.yaml file.<br>
  <code>deployChangedComponents()</code> has to be called in a parameterized job as it depends on parameters to be set.
</p>
  <p>
      <b>parameters for the containing job</b>:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>built_name</code>: integration pipeline that is used to create the component-versions.yaml
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>built_number</code>: build number of the integration pipeline
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>target_env</code>: environment to which the component-versions.yaml should be run against
        </li>
      </ul>
  </p>

      <b>Attention:</b><br>
      There is no implementation of the actual deployment.<br>
      The function only prints out the functionality that can be used for the deployment process.
