            Ensures that the given executable is available on the current Jenkins agent, installing
            it with a Jenkins tool installer if necessary. Contrary to the <code>tool</code> step the
            <code>executable</code> step doesn't install the tool if the given binary is already available
            in the PATH. Additionally the given tool installer is never called more than once in the same build.
            This is useful for implementing Pipelines and custom steps which run on agents with different
            tool availability, e.g. containerized agents. And to reduce tool installer messages
            in build logs when installing required tools in custom steps. Return the path to given binary. Note the
            difference to the <code>tool</code> step, which returns the home directory of the installed tool.

                <b>toolName</b> (optional) - Name of the Jenkins tool installer to use when the given
